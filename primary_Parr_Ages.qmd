abstract: |
    We analysed the lacustrine life stage of Sockeye Salmon (parr and presmolts) in small, warm, and eutrophic Osoyoos Lake in the Columbia River watershed. Most parr emigrate from the lake as age-1 smolts after one year of growth, but some remain to grow for another year. Thorough hydroacoustic surveys of parr abundance were conducted 2 to 7 times per year from 1996 to 2022 (ongoing). These abundances were compared to spawner abundance, using the Ricker model for evidence of habitat limitations. Analysis revealed the age composition of parr was unusable due to a misinterpretation of the survey methodology. Not knowing parr ages prevented a parr from spawners regression and prevented estimating survival of presmolts to adult returns, an indicator of marine survival. We attempted to calculate parr age composition from spawner abundance and from the freshwater ages of adults returning from the ocean, fitting a model linking these three life stages as a Bayse/Price/LaPlace regression. This is an example of merging related sources of life-history data to clarify an ecological process: fraction of parr that delay emigrating as smolts. keywords: - Sockeye Salmon - Osoyoos Lake - Oncorynchus nerka - life-history model (max 300)

# Introduction

define jargon: parr vs presmolt, brood year, smolt year, adults vs
spawners,

After two centuries of building agricultural and hydroelectric dams in
the in the Columbia River watershed, two wild populations of Sockeye
Salmon (*Oncorynchus nerka*) persist: those rearing in Lake Wenatchee
and in Osoyoos Lake (Fig\~\\ref{map}). Both result from successful
transplants of hatchery fish (refs). Extensive background information on
the history and ecology of these populations is available (refs). This
paper focuses on Osoyoos Sockeye, but is immediately applicable to the
similar Lake Wenatchee Sockeye.

\end{figure}
```
### 

The life histories of sockeye populations are well described (refs), and
the life stages of Osoyoos sockeye involves a series of habitats
(Fig\~\\ref{lifecycle}):

1.  October: spawners bury eggs in gravel beds in the Okanagan River
    upstream of Osoyoos Lake,
2.  November--April: eggs and alevins develop in that river gravel,
3.  April--May: emergent fry immigrate to the margins (littoral zone) of
    the lake,
4.  May--September: as parr, they spread throughout the lake,
5.  September--March: parr change into presmolts; not all parr change
    into presmolts and emigrate after one year in the lake, but
    previously the fraction spending a second year in the lake was
    thought to be small.
6.  April--May: presmolts emigrate from the lake as smolts \*en route\*
    to the Pacific Ocean.
7.  Adult salmon return to marine and freshwater fisheries and to the
    spawning ground after one, mainly two, or three years at sea (rarely
    longer).

Following a severe decline in the period 1994-2004, both populations
have increased in abundance recently [@akenheadscotta.; @wilkinson2016].
The abundance of spawners in the Osoyoos population led to concerns
about habitat limitations: spawning grounds area and quality, and lake
capacity for survival and growth of parr.

Sockeye parr are largely confined to the North Basin of Osoyoos Lake.
Low abundances of parr in the South Basin were observed in surveys in
early spring in 1973 (ref) and 199x (ref). Recent and contiguous surveys
were confined to the North Basin. The assumption of low parr abundance
in the South Basin is an explicit source of uncertainty in this
analysis.

## Why parr ages are important

If parr that will migrate as age 2.0 smolts are a large fraction of the
parr population but not identifed in ATS estimates and analyses, then
parr staying for a second summer will be attributed to subsequent
spawner abundance. That will result in wrong estimates of (1) survival
from eggs (as spawners) to parr, thereby wrong estimates of capacity for
spawning habitat and lake habitat; and (2) parr (as pre-smolts) to
returning adults, thereby wrong estimates of marine survival (SAR,
smolts to adult returns). This will be a severe error in cases when
abundant spawners are followed by scarce spawners. The effect is still
large if the abundant parr from brood deplete their food in the lake and
grow slowly, so that many will be too small to emigrate as age 1.0
smolts. Unless recognized, this error will shift fisheries management
toward an exploitation rate that is higher, and a spawner abundance that
is lower, than the correct optimum.

# Materials

This section describes the origins of the datasets we used. These are
arranged by life stages, riverine spawners, lacustrine parr --
eventually adults returning from the ocean.

## Spawner abundance

Uninterrupted time series of abundance estimates were available for
spawner abundance from counting live and dead spawners, 199x--202x (ref)

In Osoyoos Lake, spawner abundance estimates were estimated by computing
the area-under-the-curve (AUC) from spawner count surveys typically two
days apart throughout the peak of the spawning season (ref Spawning
Grounds Data Report, unpublished data). Briefly, the abundance of
spawners typically increases from a low number, plateaus at some annual
maximum and proceeds to decline as spawners die. Plotting these data
yields a trapezoidal shape, which is used in conjunction with an average
fish residency time (11 days for Okanagan Sockeye Salmon; Hyatt et al.,
2010, Perrin and Irvine, 1990) to estimate the cumulative abundance of
spawners in a spawning season (see Hillborn et al., 1999 for more
details). Here, we used the combined spawning ground survey data for the
Lower Okanagan River (Figure 1) as our best estimate for the total
abundance of spawners per year.

Multiple surveys of spawners occur each year. The annual abundance of
spawners was presented as two indices:

1.  PLD: peak live plus dead, using the count from just one survey to
    avoid counting the same fish more than once (ref); and

2.  AUC: area under the curve, using a straight line interpolation of
    spawner abundance between surveys and an estimate of fish residence
    time (ref). The area under the resulting trapezoid has units *fish
    times days*, divided that area by residence time with units *days*
    estimates the number of individual fish.

## **Spawner ages**

Dead pitched carcasses were collected as random samples while spawning
ground surveys were being conducted in the fall of each year (Karilyn
Alex, Fisheries Biologist, Okanagan Nation Alliance, pers. comm.).
Otoliths extracted from each carcass were used to obtain age estimates
at the \[PBS lab\]. The number of annual growth rings (annuli) on the
otoliths infer the total age of the fish and the year the fish entered
the Pacific Ocean. Fish growth in marine habitats is far greater than in
the freshwater habitats, thus a marked increase in annuli widths occurs
after the smolt life stage (Jones 1992). Consequently, we can determine
if spawners entered the marine environment as age 1.0 or age 2.0 smolts,
allowing an estimate of smolt age composition for a given year.Â

Standardized acoustic and trawl surveys (ATS) were conducted at night in
Osoyoos Lake two to seven times per year. Acoustic surveys were
conducted simultaneously by two crews surveying identical transects,
**\[was each transect sampled twice each night?\]** see Hyatt et al.
(2017) for details of survey procedures and abundance estimates;
McLennan and Simmonds (1992) for acoustics methods in fisheries science.

Biosample data from nocturnal trawls were used to decompose the total
density of limnetic fish into the relative densities of several fish
species and ages of interest. Fish biosamples were collected using a
midwater trawl net (2 m x 2 m mouth opening x 7.5 m long with stretch
mesh ranging from 5.0 cm at the mouth to 1.3 cm at the cod end)
(Erzenhofer and Hume 1989) at six depth strata. Between 5 and 15
nocturnal trawls were conducted per survey. Captured fish weighed,
measured and were typically stored on ice, although some pre-2005
samples were stored in ethanol or formalin (and weights were
correspondingly corrected using equations from Shields and Carlson 1996,
and P. Rankin, unpublished data, respectively). The objective of each
trawl was to collect a minimum of 300 juvenile Sockeye of various ages.
Sampled fish were identified as wild or hatchery-origin (absence or
presence of thermal marks on the otolith) and were aged based on scale
analyses. Nerkids were grouped into one of four categories: i) nerkids
\< 15 cm, ii) age-1 smolts or kokanee, iii) nerkids between 15 and 33
cm, and iv) fish larger than 33 cm. Proportions of these biometric
groupings were jointly used with the acoustic-based density estimates to
calculate the densities of each size class of fish.Â 

## Parr biometrics

Note: surely we have parr and pre-smolts lengths and weights. ATC method
protocol says these were collected.

## Migrating smolts abundance

Note: RST. Goal was PIT-tagging and biometrics, not pop size estimation.
So smolt abundance not used and should be deleted?

## Estimating annual abundance of parr by a mortality model

This is written twice. chop and merge.

version 1.

To estimate the annual abundance of limnetic parr, we developed a novel
methodology using non-linear regression to simultaneously use 113 ATS
surveys (across 24 consecutive years) to estimate i) daily mortality
rates, and ii) parr abundances on \[standardized date\]. In this
nonlinear model, the per capita mortality rates declines exponentially
through parr life:

$$
dN/dtN= -m_0~e^{-m_1t}
$$

where $m_0$ is the base mortality rate at $t = 0$, and $m_1$ is the rate
of decline from that base rate. This reflects a high mortality rate
during early summer in-lake life, and a low mortality rate in the winter
preceding smolt emigration. Equation @eq-declining_M is applied as
cumulative survival (the integral of the changing mortality rates) from
day zero to a preceding or following date. We chose fall equinox as day
zero ($t = 0$) in part because that was close to the median date for all
surveys. Predictions for observations of parr in summer (before day
zero) are greater than at at day zero, and predictions for presmolts in
winter are lower abundance values. The ATS observations were weighted as
an inverse function of their precision; we used the inverse of available
95% CLs, but truncated for values above the median to avoid
overemphasizing spuriously precise data.Â 

version 2

From the simplest model of population decline: a fixed *per capita*
mortality rate, we can extract simple regression to describe parr
abundance $N$ by days $t$ within lake life (one or two years).

\begin{align}
\frac{dN}{dt} & = m \\
N_t &= N_0 e^{-mt}\\
\text{log}(N_t) & = \text{log}(N_0) -mt \\
\hat{y} & \sim a -bt
\end{align}

Applied to many years, with fixed *m,* this regression estimates the
initial abundance $N_0$ at some arbitrary day. Opening *m* to vary by
day or year (indexed as *j* ) according to various factors (indexed as
*i* ) such as water flows, smolt size or smolt density, and trends
across years:

\begin{align}
\text{log}(N_{t,j}) & = \text{log}(N_{0,j}) -mt \\
 & = \text{log}(N_{0,j}) -(m_0 + \sum_i m_i) t \\
\end{align}

Preceding analyses [@hyatt2015; @hyatt2003; @hyatt2009] describe the
parr mortality rate as initially high, related to small size, and
declining to nearly zero in winter. Various models for varying *m* might
be proposed, *e.g.* $m=m_0+f(length)$; the simplest is an exponential
decrease with time:

\begin{align}
dm/dt &=-m_1 \\
m_t &= m_0~e^{-m_1 t} 
\end{align}

where *m~0~* is the rate (days^-1^) at some day *t=0*, and *m~1~*
determines how quickly *m~t~* declines through days of lake life. Note
that *t* can be negative (days before *t=0*), allowing an ecologically
meaningful, or practical, choice for day *t=0.*
$t=(-100, 0, 100), ~ m_0=0.005, ~ m_1=0.005$ then
$m_t= (0.00305, 0.0025, 0.00205)$ and survivals within each of those
days would be $(0.9918, 0.9950, 0.9970),$ allowing integration as the
cumulative product of daily survival.

To fit this non-linear model we used a steepest-descent search (R
function *optim* with algorithm BFGS, to minimize SSQ, the sum of
(predicted - observed)^2^. The model has two parts: (1) mortality rates
according to day of the year, then (2) for each generation of parr
(brood year), cumulative survivals from a fitted $N_0$ at day *t=0* for
that year to the day of each survey provides a prediction of parr
abundances.

## Parr per spawner

The spawner to parr relationship has the potential to identify patterns
in freshwater productivity and survival (references).Â 

The preceding estimates of parr annual abundance interpolated to fall
equinox, *P*, and the calibrated PC-1 of indices of spawner abundance,
*S*, were related by ordinary linear regression
$\hat{P}=a + bS+\mathcal{N}(0,\sigma)$ and as plots of parr per spawner
by year. This approach is designed to identify problems with the
assumptions of a conventional approach.
